# QR Code Watermarking Tool

## Overview
The QR Code Watermarking Tool is a powerful application that uses LSB (Least Significant Bit) steganography to embed QR code watermarks into DOCX documents. This tool provides a secure way to protect document authenticity through invisible watermarks that can be verified later.

## Features

- **QR Code Generation**: Create custom QR codes with your data
- **CRC32 Checksum**: Automatic integrity protection with CRC32 checksums for all QR codes
- **Watermark Embedding**: Invisibly embed QR codes into DOCX document images
- **Document Validation**: Extract and verify hidden QR code watermarks
- **Integrity Validation**: Validate QR code data integrity using CRC32 checksums
- **Detailed Process Visualization**: See the entire steganography process in detail
- **Quality Analysis**: Calculate MSE and PSNR metrics to evaluate image quality
- **Modern Web Interface**: User-friendly interface with responsive design
- **Backward Compatibility**: Support for both new QR codes with checksums and legacy QR codes

## How It Works

The tool uses LSB (Least Significant Bit) steganography to hide QR code data within the blue channel of images in DOCX documents. This technique modifies only the least significant bit of each pixel, making the changes imperceptible to the human eye while preserving the ability to extract the data later.

### Process Steps:

1. **Image Analysis**: Assesses the carrier image to determine capacity
2. **QR Preparation**: Prepares and potentially resizes the QR code
3. **Header Creation**: Generates header information (dimensions)
4. **LSB Embedding**: Embeds data in the LSB of the blue channel
5. **Quality Analysis**: Calculates MSE and PSNR metrics

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package manager)

### Quick Installation

**Windows:**
```bash
install.bat
```

**Linux/Mac:**
```bash
./install.sh
```

**Manual Installation:**
```bash
python -m venv venv
# Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
# Linux/Mac: source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Starting the Application

Run the application with:

```bash
# Activate the virtual environment (if not already activated)
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate

# Start the application
python app.py
```

The application will start and be accessible at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) in your web browser.

### Using the Web Interface

The application has four main functions:

1. **Generate QR Code**:
   - Enter your data
   - Click "Generate QR Code"
   - QR codes are automatically generated with CRC32 checksum for integrity protection
   - Download the generated QR code with built-in data validation

2. **Embed Watermark**:
   - Select a DOCX document
   - Select a QR code image (with or without CRC32 checksum)
   - Click "Embed Watermark"
   - Download the watermarked document

3. **Validate Document**:
   - Select a DOCX document
   - Click "Validate Document"
   - View extracted QR codes (if any)

4. **Validate QR Code Integrity**:
   - Select a QR code image
   - Click "Validate Integrity CRC32"
   - Verify if the QR code data has been modified or corrupted
   - View original data, checksum status, and creation timestamp

## Technical Details

### CRC32 Checksum Integration

All QR codes generated by this tool now include CRC32 checksums for data integrity validation:

- **Automatic Protection**: Every new QR code includes a CRC32 checksum and timestamp
- **Data Format**: QR codes contain JSON data: `{"data": "original_text", "crc32": checksum_value, "timestamp": unix_timestamp}`
- **Integrity Validation**: Verify if QR code data has been modified or corrupted
- **Backward Compatibility**: Legacy QR codes without checksums are still supported
- **Security Enhancement**: Provides an additional layer of data validation

### LSB Steganography

This tool implements LSB (Least Significant Bit) steganography, which works by replacing the least significant bit of each color channel with a bit of the data to be hidden. Since the least significant bit has the smallest impact on the color value, changes are virtually imperceptible to the human eye.

The implementation:
- Uses only the blue channel (less sensitive to the human eye)
- Includes dimension information in the header
- Automatically resizes QR codes if necessary to fit image capacity
- Calculates quality metrics (MSE, PSNR) to quantify the impact
- Supports both traditional QR codes and new CRC32-protected QR codes

### Image Quality Metrics

- **MSE (Mean Squared Error)**: Measures the average squared difference between the original and watermarked images.
- **PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio)**: Measures the ratio between the maximum possible power of a signal and the power of corrupting noise.
  - PSNR > 40 dB: Excellent quality
  - PSNR > 30 dB: Very good quality
  - PSNR > 20 dB: Good quality
  - PSNR < 20 dB: Poor quality

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **No images found**: Ensure your DOCX document contains images
- **Error during extraction**: The document may not contain watermarked images
- **Low PSNR values**: Image quality may be too low for effective watermarking
- **CRC32 validation failed**: QR code data may be corrupted or modified - try with the original QR code
- **Legacy QR code**: Old QR codes without CRC32 checksums will show as "format lama" but still work
